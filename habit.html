				Nudibranchs can be found in seas worldwide.
			</h1>
			<p class="p3">
				Their habitats range from the Arctic through to temperate and tropical regions, and to the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. They are almost entirely restricted to salt water, although a few species are known to inhabit lower salinities in brackish water.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="content4">
			<p class="p3" id="alldepths">
				Nudibranchs live at virtually all depths, from the intertidal zone to depths well over 700 m (2,300 ft). The greatest diversity of nudibranchs are seen in warm, shallow reefs, although one nudibranch species was discovered at a depth near 2,500 m (8,200 ft).
			</p>
			<p class="p3" id="benthic">
				Nudibranchs are benthic animals, found crawling over the substrate. The only exceptions to this are: neustonic Glaucus , which float upside down just under the ocean's surface; Cephalopyge trematoides, which swim in the water column; and Phylliroe bucephalum.
